```
Reading the Dean's Dilemma case study dataset into a data frame for futher investigation and insights.
```{r}
dd <- read.csv(paste("DeansDilemmaData.csv",sep=""))
dd
attach(dd)

```
Now having a further look into the Dataset by calculating the summary statistics for important variables.
```{r}
summary(dd$Percent_SSC)

```
```{r}
summary(dd$Percent_HSC)
```
```{r}
summary(dd$Percent_Degree)
```
```{r}
describe(dd$Salary)
```

lets use R to calculate the median salary of all the students in the data sample
```{r}
median(dd$Salary)
```
Use R to calculate the percentage of students who were placed, correct to 2 decimal places.
```{r}
mytable <- table(dd$Placement)
round(prop.table(mytable)*100,3)
summary(dd$Placement)
100*mean(dd$Placement_B)


```

Lets  use R to create a dataframe called placed, that contains a subset of only those students who were successfully placed. 
```{r}
newdata <- subset(dd,Placement_B=='1',select=c(SlNo,Gender,Percent_SSC,
Percent_HSC,S.TEST.SCORE,Percent_MBA,Placement,Placement_B,Specialization_MBA,Salary))
head(newdata)
#placed <- mba[ which(mba$Placement=='Placed') , ] 
#View(placed)
```
Lets use R to find the  median salary of students who were placed.
```{r}
median(newdata$Salary)
```
Lets use R to create a table showing the mean salary of males and females, who were placed. 
```{r}
aggregate(newdata$Salary,by= list(Gender=newdata$Gender),mean)
```

Lets use R to generate the following histogram showing a breakup of the MBA performance of the students who were placed
```{r}
hist(newdata$Percent_MBA,xlim=c(50,80),ylim=c(0,150),xlab="MBAPercentage",ylab="Count",breaks=3,main="MBA Performance of placed students",col=c("lightblue"))

```
Lets create a dataframe called notplaced, that contains a subset of only those students who were NOT placed after their MBA.
```{r}
notplaced <- subset(dd,Placement_B=='0',select=c(SlNo,Gender,Percent_SSC,
Percent_HSC,S.TEST.SCORE,Percent_MBA,Placement,Placement_B,Specialization_MBA,Salary))
head(notplaced)
```
Draw two histograms side-by-side, visually comparing the MBA performance of Placed and Not Placed students, as follows:

```{r, warnings=FALSE,fig.height=5,fig.width=9}
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
hist(newdata$Percent_MBA,xlim=c(50,80),ylim=c(0,150),xlab="MBAPercentage",
     ylab="Count",
     breaks=3,
     main="MBA Performance of placed students",
     col=c("lightblue"))
hist(notplaced$Percent_MBA,xlim=c(50,80),ylim=c(0,150),xlab="MBAPercentage",
     ylab="Count",
     breaks=3,
     main="MBA Performance of placed students",
     col=c("lightblue"))
```


Lets use R to draw two boxplots, one below the other, comparing the distribution of salaries of males and females who were placed, as follows:
```{r}
boxplot( Salary ~ Gender, data= newdata,horizontal=TRUE,yaxt="n",
        xlab="Salary",ylab="Gender",
        main="Comparison of Salaries of Male and Females")
        axis(side=2,at=c(1,2),labels=c("Females","Males"))
```

Lets create a dataframe called placedET, representing students who were placed after the MBA and who also gave some MBA entrance test before admission into the MBA program. 
```{r}
placedET <-  subset(dd,Placement_B=='1' & S.TEST=='1',select=c(SlNo,Gender,Percent_SSC,
Percent_HSC,S.TEST.SCORE,Percent_MBA,Percentile_ET,Placement,Placement_B,Specialization_MBA,Salary))
head(placedET)
```

Drawing a Scatter Plot Matrix for 3 variables -- {Salary, Percent_MBA, Percentile_ET} using the dataframe placedET.
```{r}
scatterplot.matrix(formula= ~Salary + Percent_MBA + Percentile_ET,cex=0.6,
                   data=placedET,diagonal="density")
```
```{r include=FALSE}
# corrgram(store, order=TRUE, lower.panel=panel.shade,
#  upper.panel=panel.pie, text.panel=panel.txt,
#  main="Corrogram of Store variables")
```
